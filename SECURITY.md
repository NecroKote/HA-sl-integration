## Reporting a vulnerability

To report a security problem go to our [issues](https://github.com/hasl-platform/integration/issues) and search so no one else already have reported it, then open a [new](https://github.com/hasl-platform/integration/issues/new) and tag it using the `Security` tag. We will prioritize reports having this tag.
