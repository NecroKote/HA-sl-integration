# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

During the time where we will migrate to HASLv3 we do also support HASL. However expect this to end, even for security fixes, during the fall of 2021. We recomend using HASLv3 if you are able to do that as it is in active development.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 3.x     | :white_check_mark: |
| 2.2.7   | :white_check_mark: |
| <2.2.7  | :x:                |

## Reporting a vulnerability

To report a security problem goto our [issues](https://github.com/DSorlov/hasl-platform/issues) and search so no one else already have reported it, then open a [new](https://github.com/DSorlov/hasl-platform/issues/new) and tag it using the `Security` tag. We will prioritize reports having this tag.
