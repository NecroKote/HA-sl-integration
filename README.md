Home Assistant SL Integration (HASL)
====================================

This is an Home Assistant integration providing sensors for Stockholms Lokaltrafik in Stockholms LÃ¤n, Sweden. It provides intelligent sensors for departures, deviations, vehicle locations, traffic status and route monitoring using the SL official APIs. It also provides services for Location ID lookup and Trip Planing. You will still need to get your own API keys from SL / Trafiklab (se docs for [HASL](https://hasl.sorlov.com)). This integration supports modern configuration and are beeing updated also to use the newest APIs from SL.

Full and detailed documentation is available [http://hasl.sorlov.com](http://hasl.sorlov.com).

## Install using HACS

* If you haven't already you must have [HACS installed](https://hacs.xyz/docs/setup/download).
* Go into HACS and search for HASL under the Integrations headline. You will need to restart Home Assistant to finish the process.
* Once that is done reload your GUI (caching issues preventing the integration to be shown).
* Goto Integrations and add HASL integrations.
* Get API-keys at TrafikLab, read details in [documentation](https://hasl.sorlov.com/trafiklab)
* Location IDs can be found using [SL Platsuppslag v1](https://developer.trafiklab.se/api/sl-platsuppslag/konsol)
* Perhaps add some GUI/Lovelace components as examples shows in the [documentation](https://hasl.sorlov.com/lovelace_cards)
* Enjoy!

## Visualisation

The sensors should be able to be used multiple cards in hasl-cards ([departure-card](https://github.com/hasl-platform/lovelace-hasl-departure-card), [traffic-status-card](https://github.com/hasl-platform/lovelace-hasl-traffic-status-card)) . There are several cards for different sensors and presentation options for each sensor type. [More examples](https://hasl.sorlov.com/lovelace_cards) can be found in the [documentation](https://hasl.sorlov.com/).
