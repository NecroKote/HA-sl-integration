Home Assistant SL Sensor (HASLv3)
=================================

This is a integration to provide multiple sensors for Stockholms Lokaltrafik in Stockholm, Sweden.
It provides intelligent sensors for Departures, Deviations, Vehicle Locations and Traffic Status. It also provides services for Location ID lookup and Trip Planing.

You have to install it as a custom component using HACS (or manual) and you need to get your own API keys from SL / Trafiklab.

## This is NOT the current release

Install that via HACS. Read more at http://hasl.sorlov.com

This repo is not the current release, it is the development branch.

## This IS the development branch

Currently this integration is going into some major overhauling to provide the next level experience for a sensor of this type.

Major rehauling of most of the components, config and logic to provide a more stable and intelligent use of the APIs.

This branch is for now mostly unusable if you are not part of the dev group or like adventures.
