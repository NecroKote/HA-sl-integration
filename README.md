Home Assistant SL Sensor (HASLv3)
=================================

This is a integration to provide multiple sensors for Stockholms Lokaltrafik in Stockholm, Sweden.
It provides intelligent sensors for Departures, Deviations, Vehicle Locations and Traffic Status. It also provides services for Location ID lookup and Trip Planing.

You have to install it using HACS (or manual install) and you need to get your own API keys from SL / Trafiklab.

Currently this integration is going into some major overhauling to provide the next level experience.
This branch is for now mostly unusable if you are not part of the dev team or have a strange liking of death-trap like adventures.

Documentation is available at http://hasl.sorlov.com

## Legacy

HASL is still available from https://github.com/DSorlov/hasl-platform for those who are afraid of progressing and learning new things and for those who prefer the old yaml configuration method and the old sensor architechture.
